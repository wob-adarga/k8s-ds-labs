# DS-APPS

This area holds a collection of web applications written
by data scientists and deployed into the `ds-lab-1` cluster.

Each web application is exposed to the internet via the URL
`<name>.ds-lab-1.datascience.adarga.dev` but is protected from
usage outside of adarga employees by an authentication mechanism
implemented in the shared load balancer layer above the apps.

See [https://adarga.atlassian.net/l/c/BW90Y32Q] for more info.
